## ❓FAQ

### Can't open ChatGPT

> If you cannot open the application after the upgrade, please try to clear the configuration file, which is in the `~/.chatgpt/*` directory.

### Out of sync login status between multiple windows

> If you have already logged in in the main window, but the system tray window shows that you are not logged in, you can fix it by restarting the application (`Menu -> Preferences -> Restart ChatGPT`).

### Is it safe?

> It's safe, just a wrapper for [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) website, no other data transfer exists (you can check the source code).

### Developer cannot be verified?

- [Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac)
