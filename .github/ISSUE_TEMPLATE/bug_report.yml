      Please **DO NOT** file issues here if you are having problems with ChatGPT itself. Issues should **ONLY** be created here for bugs that pertain to this package, [lencx/ChatGPT](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT). If you are experiencing an issue on [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com), please contact **OpenAI** for support or submit feedback through ChatGPT itself. If you **only have an issue with this app** and do not have the issue on [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com), please file an issue here.

      Please make sure to [search for existing issues](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/issues) before filing a new one!

      **Name your issue appropriately:** give it a sentence that reads well enough for anyone seeing this in the release notes to know what it is.

      When writing out the issue details, please ensure you are writing it as if you were explaining it to somebody else, even if you will be working on and resolving the issue yourself. This helps others to understand the reasons for the issue and for it to be searchable in the future.
